            <h2>Minecraft</h2>
            <p>Markus "Notch" Persson started working on Minecraft in 2009 as a hobby project inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and Infiniminer. The game was originally called "Cave Game" and then "Minecraft: Order of the Stone" before settling on its final name, which is a combination of the words "mine" and "craft".</p>

        <div class="game-card">
            <img src="images/Stardew.png" alt="Stardew Valley" width="300" height="300">
            <h2>Stardew Valley</h2>
            <p>Stardew Valley was created by game designer Eric Barone, under the alias of ConcernedApe. During the four years he spent solo-developing it, he taught himself the necessary skills to produce the game's music, art, programming, and design.</p>

            <h2>Dead Rising 2</h2>
            <p>Capcom created a variety of websites before the release of the game. These include TapeitorDie.Com, visitfortunecity.com, and deadrising-2.com.

                In August 2010, Keiji Inafune released an eight-part video series entitled Zombrex: Dead Rising Sun. Capcom sponsored a gathering of zombies at the London House of Parliament on August 30â€” the best dressed won a game console. Attendees also received a limited edition, one-of-a-kind T-shirt.</p>
